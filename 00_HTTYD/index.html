                        How to Train Your Dragon is a 2010 American animated fantasy film directed by Chris Sanders and
                        Dean DeBlois and written by Sanders, DeBlois and Will Davies, based on the 2003 novel by
                        Cressida Cowell.
                        Produced by DreamWorks Animation, the film stars the voices of Jay Baruchel, Gerard Butler,
                        Craig Ferguson, America Ferrera, Jonah Hill, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, T.J. Miller, and Kristen
                        Wiig.
                        The story takes place in Berk, a mythical Viking village; Hiccup, an undersized teen outcast and
                        son of the village chieftain, wishing to become a dragon slayer like the other Vikings, injures
                        a rare Night Fury dragon but is unable to bring himself to kill it.
                        He instead helps and befriends the dragon, and quickly discovers that things are not exactly as
                        they seem in the conflict between Vikings and dragons.
